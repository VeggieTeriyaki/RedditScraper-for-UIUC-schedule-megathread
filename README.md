# Basic overview of this notebook:
I used PRAW, a reddit wrapper class, in order to scrape data from the spring 2017 schedule megathread from the UIUC subreddit, and then visualised it using pandas in order to make interesting observations.
# Vision for the project:
This is still a project in its infancy; the master plan is to make a website that can visualise data on any subreddit on demand at any time.
